* SYNOPSIS

  *hadk.<tool>* /-f <device file> options/

* DESCRIPTION

  HADK-tools is a collection helper scripts around the Sailfish SDK mainly focused
  on setup an environment for development and executing actions into thes.

  The most common task is to build a hardware adaptation or to execute any command
  in that environment.

  These tools are:
  + hadk.env :: Create, Update and enter the given SDK
  + hadk.source :: Sync and setup adaption sources
  + hadk.build :: Build adaption


* BASIC SETUP

  Most of the device files will first load a file that contains the paths to the most
  basic settings.
  This file is usually called /local.base.hadk/ and contains these contents:
  #+begin_src sh
  # Root of the sources used during development
  SOURCE_ROOT=$HOME/dev/sailfish/hadk

  # Path for the change roots containing the SDKs
  CHRTDIR=$HOME/dev/vms/sfos
  # Sailfish OS SDK directory
  SFOSSDK_DIR="$CHRTDIR"/sdks/sfossdk

  # Ubuntu change root directory
  UBUCHRT_DIR="$CHRTDIR"/sdks/ubuchrt
  #+end_src

  Save this file in $HOME/.local/hadk/local.base.hadk.

  After saving the configuration the basic setup is done and the SDKs can be setup with /hadk.env/.
